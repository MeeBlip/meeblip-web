Web tools for MeeBlip control and editing

To create patches:
* Tweak knobs and switches
* Select the MIDI port and channel your MeeBlip is using
* Click the "send" button to send MIDI config data to your MeeBlip. (Make sure you've got the right port and channel selected!)

Click the "patch link" button to save your patch.  Save the link to a bookmarks folder, put it in a web page, email it to a friend, share it on Twitter, etc.  By saving patch URLs you can create shareable libraries of sounds for your MeeBlip!
